    Test Page
    </h1>
    <p>
    This is a test page, with links to various examples of Flask uses and applications. These include an example of templates,
        Jinja, a Flask data upload, which stores a file to memory, and some example Dash Apps. Over time the goals are to make
        create a fully fledged website that includes data processing and visualization tools. Please view the links below to see
        the various examples I created. This page is currently configured to work on localhost.

    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload_site">File Upload Site</a>
    <div> Files uploaded to the site can be found at url/tmp/-filename-</div>

    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/data_test">Data test page </a> <br>
    <div> This page downloads a csv, parses it, and displays the data in a nicely formatted way </div>
    <br>
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/test_page/banana">Test page banana </a> <br>
    <div> This flask route  demonstrates variable rules. See app3 code for more details </div>
    <br>
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashapp">Dash App 1</a> <br>
   <div> This flask route  demonstrates a sample interactive Dash Graph </div>

    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashapp2">Dash App 2</a> <br>
    <div> This flask route  demonstrates a sample interactive Dash Graph </div>
    <br>


  <div>
        Another cool feature of Flask is Jinja, which allows allows me to pass in information or variables using double curly brackets. This is a name passed into the template via Jinja: {{author}}
    <div>

    <p> Notes on this work can be found on my Google drive, and in the code repository itself. Some important things to note:
        I create the Flask and Dash objects differently than most tutorials show. This is to create a Flask driven website,
        capable of controlling many routes, but that also allows some of those routes to contain dash apps and dashboards.

        See these code snippets for a better idea:
<br>
        <br>
        # Create the Flask object:
        <br>
        server = flask.Flask(__name__),
<br>
        <br>
        #Create a dash object:
        <br>
        app = dash.Dash(__name__, server=server, url_base_pathname='/dashapp', external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)
<br>
        <br>
        # Define a route using @server.route(...):
        <br>
        @server.route('/data_test')
        def data_test():
    </p>
